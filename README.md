# Synthesizable-Implementation-Of-Vending-Machine
◦ Designed a circuit for vending machine using verilog that can be easily implemented on FPGA. ◦ Integrated a wrapper for RTL that can apply input as well as display the output on built-in LEDs on FPGA. ◦ Performed optimization to reduce hardware overhead in the circuit.
